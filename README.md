# Quaffle
This is an iOS game developed by objective-C. Basic idea is the player can use a red Quaffle (a ball) to collide another black Quaffle to keep it fly. As longer as the player can keep the black Quaffle flying, he can keep earning score, otherwise, the score will reduce. Main work: Game design, game development.
